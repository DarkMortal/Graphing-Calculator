# Graphing Calculator from scratch using p5.js and math.js
This was a fun side project I made during the first year of my college.
Planning this entire thing was no easy job. The main challenge was computing the specific part of the graph that needs to be drawn.
Another challenge was configuring the zoom-in and zoom-out events.

## Capabilities include
- Plots equations on a graph which can be saved as high-quality images.
- Highlight area under curve for various equations by adjusting the range.
- Zoom-in and zoom-out capabilities are available as per needs.
- Navigate through the graph with ease using right-clicking and moving the mouse-cursor.
